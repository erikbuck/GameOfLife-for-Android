# GameOfLife-for-Android
This is a simple implementation of the famous Game Of Life in Java for Android.

The Game of Life is a 'cellular automaton' invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

This project was developed using Android Studio 2.0.  The Java source code and Android resources for the Game Of Life are provided here, but I'm not sure if all the Android Studio Project/Gradle build files and items generated by Android Studio are included here.

To enable assertions, make sure the application is compiled with DEBUG enabled. In Android Studio, use the Build->Edit Build Types... menu. Select the "Debug" build type and make sure the "debuggable" option is set to true. Assertions make my application run a 1/20th the speed it runs without the assertions enabled. You may want to use Build->Edit Build Types... menu to set the "debuggable" option to false to have reasonable performance.
